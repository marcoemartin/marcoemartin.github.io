      <title>Hijacking Syscall Table</title>

      <description>In my Operating Systems course we learned about Linux kernels and where then asked to hijack a basic kernel.
Some Background Their are two kinds of processes - User mode and privileged processes. Since some commands could literally brick your computer or be used to steal personal information the OS prevents just any process to use certain commands unless they are privileged. For further detail refer to this explanation.
The commands are further hidden by the fact that they are called internally by digits so that user processes can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;guess&amp;rdquo;, enter the System Call Table.</description>

      <title>Creating My First Hugo Website</title>

      <description>For some time now I have been wanting to create a personal website to show case my projects and as a way to let others get to know me a bit better. I finally found enough courage to do it when I learned about Hugo. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that uses the command line as its interface.
It is super fast at building and launching a website, just look at that speed!</description>
